# Week 1 Evidence

This folder contains supporting evidence for the Week 1 Weekly Status Submission for the senior thesis project.

## Week 1 Focus

The planned Week 1 milestone was to complete the literature review and finalize the research design.

In addition to completing those tasks, work also progressed on several later project activities, including historical-baseline preparation, weather-feature engineering, and development-period weather-feature auditing.

## Evidence Included

### Figures

- `annual_extreme_weather_features.png`  
  Shows annual patterns in the four engineered extreme-weather indicators during the 2000–2021 development period.

- `w03_e01_relationship.png`  
  Shows the relationship between July mean temperature and July hot-day count. This relationship was flagged for later multicollinearity evaluation during linear-model development.

### Summary Outputs

- `development_feature_summary.csv`  
  Descriptive statistics for the ten engineered weather predictors using 2000–2021 development data.

- `e02_by_year.csv`  
  Annual summary of severe-heat exposure above 35°C.

- `high_correlation_pairs.csv`  
  Identifies strongly correlated weather predictors observed during the development-period audit.

- `weather_feature_audit_decisions.csv`  
  Documents the feature-retention decisions resulting from the development-period audit.

The 2022–2025 final holdout period was not used to make feature-selection decisions.
